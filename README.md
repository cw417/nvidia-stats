## About
NvidiaStats is a command line GPU stat reporting application written for use in a Linux-based operating system running the Xorg display server with proprietary Nvidia drivers. Currently, it will report GPU utilization, GPU clock, GPU temperature, VRAM utilization, VRAM clock, and fan speed.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Linux-based operating system
    - Xorg display server
- Nvidia GPU running proprietary nvidia drivers
- Python 3.6+
- Python dependencies:
  - matplotlib
  - pandas

### Installing
1) Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/cw417/nvidia-stats`
2) Ensure you are using prorietary drivers compatible with the NvidiaStats:
    - `cat /etc/X11/xorg.conf | grep nvidia-xconfig`
    - If this returns an output, you are using proprietary Nvidia drivers
3) Install the necessary python dependencies
    - `pip install matplotlib pandas`
4) Run NvidiaStats: 
    - Change directory into the cloned NvidiaStats directory: `cd nvidia-stats`
    - Run the app: `python3 run.py`

## How It Works
 - GPU stats are obtained via the subprocess module running the `nvidia-smi -q` command with the specified stat output option
 - Output from the subprocess module is parsed via regex
 - The regex match output is written to a CSV file, as well as formatted and printed to the command line
 - Matplotlib reads the CSV file for updates, and plots the live output on a graph
